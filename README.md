### In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

**Assalum alaikum,**

My name is **Muhammad Hamza Siddiq**. I am a dedicated software developer with nearly two decades of experience. As a British citizen and native English speaker, I have spent over thirteen years honing my craft in the UK, and I am now based in Pakistan.

With a 1st class honours degree in Software Engineering from the University of Paisley in Scotland, my career as a professional .NET developer has provided me with extensive expertise in C# and SQL Server. Recently, I have been focusing on a number of projects centred around MongoDB, Web API, and Blazor.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to my religion and family. I strive to make a positive impact on the world around me, balancing my career aspirations with my personal values.
